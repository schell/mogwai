`mogwai` is a frontend DOM library for creating web applications.
It is written in Rust and runs in your browser and has enough functionality server-side
to do rendering. It is an alternative to React, Backbone, Ember, Elm, Purescript, etc.

## goals

* provide a declarative approach to creating and managing DOM nodes
* encapsulate component state and compose components easily
* explicate DOM updates
* be small and fast (snappy af)

If mogwai achieves these goals, which I think it does, then maintaining
application state, composing widgets and reasoning about your program will be
easy. Furthermore, your users will be happy because their UI is snappy!

## concepts
The main concepts behind `mogwai` are

* **channels instead of callbacks** - view events like clicks, blurs, etc are transmitted
  into a channel instead of invoking a callback. Receiving ends of channels can be branched
  and may have their output messages be mapped, filtered and folded. `mogwai`'s channels are
  many-producer, many-consumer and are immediate - they do not perform buffering and do not
  require polling.

* **views are dumb** - a `View` is just a bit of DOM that receives and transmits messages.
  When a `View` goes out of scope and is dropped in Rust, it is also dropped from the DOM.
  `Views` may be constructed and nested using plain Rust functions or an RSX macro.

* **widgets are folds over input messages** - the user interface widget in `mogwai` is a `Gizmo`.
  The `Gizmo` type holds an internally mutable state and can communicate messages to its `View`,
  which may live out in the DOM. Its `View` can send messages back to the `Gizmo`, which triggers
  the `Gizmo`'s update function. The `Gizmo`'s update function can mutate the state variable and
  send output messages to the `View`, which in turn updates the DOM.

* **communication is easy** - just `gizmo.send(&my_message)` to send a message into a gizmo
  and the gizmo will run its update logic and patch the view accordingly.

## example
Here is an example of a button that counts the number of times it has been clicked:

```rust
use mogwai::prelude::*;

pub struct Button {
    pub clicks: i32
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum ButtonIn {
    Click
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum ButtonOut {
    Clicks(String)
}

impl Component for Button {
    type ModelMsg = ButtonIn;
    type ViewMsg = ButtonOut;
    type DomNode = HtmlElement;

    fn update(
        &mut self,
        msg: &ButtonIn,
        tx_view: &Transmitter<ButtonOut>,
        _subscriber: &Subscriber<ButtonIn>
    ) {
        match msg {
            ButtonIn::Click => {
                self.clicks += 1;
                let text = if self.clicks == 1 {
                    "Clicked 1 time".to_string()
                } else {
                    format!("Clicked {} times", self.clicks)
                };
                tx_view.send(&ButtonOut::Clicks(text))
            }
        }
    }

    // Notice that the `Component::view` function returns a `ViewBuilder<T>` and not
    // a `View<T>`.
    fn view(
        &self,
        tx: &Transmitter<ButtonIn>,
        rx: &Receiver<ButtonOut>
    ) -> ViewBuilder<HtmlElement> {
        let tx_event = tx.contra_map(|_:&Event| ButtonIn::Click);
        let rx_text = rx.branch_map(|ButtonOut::Clicks(text)| text.clone());

        builder!(
            // Create a button that transmits a message into tx_event on click.
            <button on:click=tx_event>
                // Using braces we can embed rust values in our DOM.
                // Here we're creating a text node that starts with the
                // string "Clicked 0 times" and then updates every time a
                // message is received on rx_text.
                {("Clicked 0 times", rx_text)}
            </button>
        )
    }
}
// To create a new gizmo/widget/component we simply convert a value of the Button type
// into a Gizmo...
let gizmo = Gizmo::from(Button{ clicks: 0 });
// ...and create a View from that gizmo's builder.
let view = View::from(gizmo.view_builder());
// Queue some messages for the component, as if the button had been clicked:
gizmo.send(&ButtonIn::Click);
gizmo.send(&ButtonIn::Click);

assert_eq!(&view.html_string(), "<button>Clicked 2 times</button>");

if cfg!(target_arch = "wasm32") {
    // running a view adds its DOM to the document.body and ownership is passed to the window,
    // so this only works in the browser
    view.run().unwrap_throw()
}

// After handing off the view the gizmo itself may fall out of scope and be dropped. The
// view is all that is needed for your app to run.
```

## introduction
If you're interested in learning more - please read the [introduction and
documentation](https://docs.rs/mogwai/).

## why
Rust is beginning to have a good number of frontend libraries. Many
encorporate a virtual DOM with a magical update phase. Even in a language that
has performance to spare this step can cause unwanted slowness and can be hard to
reason about _what_ is updating, exactly.

In `mogwai`, channel-like primitives and a declarative view builder are used to
define components and then wire them together. Once the interface is defined and
built, the channels are effectively erased and it's functions all the way down.
There's no performance overhead from vdom, shadow dom, polling or patching. So if
you prefer a functional style of programming with lots of maps and folds - or if
you're looking to go _vroom!_ then maybe `mogwai` is right for you :)

Please do keep in mind that `mogwai` is still in alpha and the API is actively
changing - PRs, issues and questions are welcomed.

### made for rustaceans, by a rustacean
`mogwai` is a Rust first library. There is no requirement that you have `npm` or
`node`. Getting your project up and running without writing any javascript is easy
enough.

### performance
`mogwai` is snappy! Here is some very handwavey and sketchy todomvc benchmarketing:

## ok - where do i start?
First you'll need new(ish) version of the rust toolchain. For that you can visit
https://rustup.rs/ and follow the installation instructions.

Then you'll need [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).

For starting a new mogwai project we'll use the wonderful `cargo-generate`, which
can be installed using `cargo install cargo-generate`.

Then run
```shell
cargo generate --git https://github.com/schell/mogwai-template.git
```
and give the command line a project name. Then `cd` into your sparkling new
project and
```shell
wasm-pack build --target web
```
Then, if you don't already have it, `cargo install basic-http-server` or use your
favorite alternative to serve your app:
```shell
basic-http-server -a 127.0.0.1:8888
```
Happy hacking! :coffee: :coffee: :coffee:

## cookbook
:green_book: [Cooking with Mogwai](https://zyghost.com/guides/mogwai-cookbook/index.html) is a series
of example solutions to various UI problems. It aims to be a good reference doc but not a step-by-step tutorial.
